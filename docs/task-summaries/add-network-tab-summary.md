# Task Summary: Add Network Tab to Sidebar

## Task Overview
Added a Network tab to the LifeFlow sidebar to provide easy access to the network visualization and contact management features.

## Completed Actions
1. Added the Network tab to the sidebar menu in `components/sidebar.tsx`
2. Used the Users icon from Lucide for the Network tab
3. Configured the tab to link to the existing `/dashboard/network` page
4. Verified the change worked in both desktop and mobile views

## Technical Details
- The tab was added to the existing routes array in the Sidebar component
- The change leverages the existing styling and active state management in the sidebar
- The mobile sidebar automatically inherits the changes since it uses the main Sidebar component

## Future Work
- Consider adding additional quick links to specific network views
- If network features expand, consider adding sub-navigation

## GitHub Issue
Created issue documentation for this task in `docs/github-issues/add-network-tab.md`
